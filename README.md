# ML Model implementation
Implementation of ML models like Decision tree, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and many other

1) dectree_model: Implementation of "Decision tree" algorithm with accurary calculation using confusion matrix and decision tree regressor on "iris.csv" dataset.

2) linear_regression_model: Implementation of linear regression on "USA_Housing.csv" dataset.

3) logistic_regression_model: Implementation of logistic regresssion on "titanic_train.csv" dataset.

4) knn_model: Implementation of K Nearest Neighbour on "wisc_bc_data.csv" dataset.

5) svm_model1: Implementation of Support Vector Machine(SVM) on "letterdata.csv" dataset.

6) svm_model2: Implementation of Support Vector Machine(SVM) using different kernels.

7) naive_bayes_model: Implementation of Naive Bayes on "wine.xls"

8) decision_tree_model1: Implementation of Decision tree algorithm on "wine.xls" and the decision tree and the regularised tree for the same are in "wine_tree.dot" and "wine_tree_regularized.dot" respectively and their pictorial renderings are as follows:
